# Independent-Project-3-Arrays-and-Looping.-
Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with exceptions.


## Beep, Boop, I don't think I can do that Dave.
Script adds a number or into a string from the user supplied number input box.
Loops from 0 to the value of the number input,then takes the number and returns it as a text. 
If the input has a 1, it is set to return "Beep". If it contains a 2, then it returns "Boop" and if it contains 3, it'll return "Dave". 
Finally, after program loops through all the numbers, added to our output, and displayed below the input box. Subsequently every value run through the loop will be displayed on its own line thereafter with a list. 

This is shown via:
```myoutput = myoutput.concat(returnvalue, "<li>" );```

Spec: The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number
 ** Input: "4"
 * Output: "0, 1, 2, 3, 4"
 ** Input: "9"
 * Output: "0, Beep, Boop, 'Dave', 4, 5, etc
