# Independent-Project-3-Arrays-and-Looping.-
Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with exceptions if it contains certain digits.


## Beep, Boop, I don't think I can do that Dave.
 A user is provided an input box for which to supply a number. The application then computes the number from 0 to the value of the number provided. If the input contains a 1, it returns a "Beep". If it contains a 2, then it returns "Boop" and, if it contains 3, it'll return "Dave, I don't think I can do that". In referance to the AI computer HAL, from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Finally, after the program loops through all the numbers from 0 to X, they are displayed under the input box. Subsequently every value run through the loop will be displayed on its own line thereafter with in a list. 

This is shown via:
```myoutput = myoutput.concat(returnvalue, "<li>" );```

Spec: The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number
 ** Input: "4"
 * Output: "0, 1, 2, 3, 4"
 ** Input: "9"
 * Output: "0, Beep, Boop, 'Dave', 4, 5, etc
