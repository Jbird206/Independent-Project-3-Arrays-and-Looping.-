# Independent-Project-3-Arrays-and-Looping.-
Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with exceptions.


Beep, Boop, I don't think I can do that Dave.
Script adds number or text into a string from the user input box.
Loops from 0 to the value of the number input,then takes the number and returns it a text. 
If the input has a 1, it is set to return "Beep". If it contains a 2, then it returns "Boop" and if it contains 3, it'll return "Dave". 
Finally, it returns an output on a line below the input box, and subsequently every value run through the loop will be displayed on its own line thereafter. 

This is shown via:
```myoutput = myoutput.concat(returnvalue, "<li>" );```
